PASS Core is the central backend service within the PASS application that manages the core data model. It provides an 
Elide JSON:API based interface to handle essential entities, including submissions, users, repositories, and policies. 
Both the UI and backend services interact with the data model using JSON:API. PASS core is responsible for access 
control and authorization, event handling and notifications.

A full list of all the Eclipse PASS projects can be found in the PASS Main repository [README](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main).
